# Maximum Cap Search
A repository containing scripts for finding maximum caps by Jaron Wang with guidance from [Professor Robert Won](https://faculty.washington.edu/robwon/index.html) for the WXML group "The Card Game Set and Affine Geometry" Fall Quarter 2019.

More information on caps can be found [[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05117)]. 
A more intuitive view on affine geometry in terms of the card game set can be found [[here](https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/D.Maclagan/papers/set.pdf)].

Note: In this repository, I refer to a cap in which no point can be added without invalidating the cap as maximal, and a cap of largest cardinal size to be a maximum cap. In the other literature, the first is referred to as complete and maximal respectively. This is because I think this terminology is more standard.

## Algorithms
### Cap Validation Search


### Flat Elimination Search

## Known Issues
While the parameter q is a parameter in all the files given, changing this parameter to a value which is not 3 is currently not supported. (in contexts where d and n are also specified)
